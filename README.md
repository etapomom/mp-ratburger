Like ZBlood but in ZScript so that it rhymes or whatever.
### What's this
This mod aims to recreate Blood's gameplay in GZDoom using the voodoo arts of ZScript. While it isn't a 1:1 recreation (duh), the goal is to make the gameplay feel as close to Blood as possible, while mantaining stuff fresh and nice, with unnecessarilly fancy particle effects that will chug on them slaughtermaps. Spill some!
### Currently Implemented
- Pitchfork
- Bloodhound (New weapon)
	- Optional pistol start weapon that's just a slow shooting revolver.
- Shotgun
- Tommygun
- Napalm Launcher
- Dynamite
- Proximity Dynamite
- Remote Dynamite
- Tesla Cannon
- Blood's gore
### In progress
- Flaregun
- Spray Can
- Tesla Cannon
- Life Leech
- Voodoo Doll
- Blood (kinda)
- Powerups
- Bloodbath (Beast transformation)
### Stuff that will most likely not be included
- Blood's monsters
	- Might do an addon later.
- Also its armor system
	- It's way too complex and it would be impossible to make it compatible with every custom damagetype out there.
- Damage kickback physics
	- Also too complex and not that necessary imo, the growing explosion splash is in the mod tho.
### Currently known issues
- Resurrecting after dying with the Akimbo Guns powerup on makes the weapon repeat the deselect animation over and over, manually selecting other weapons solves this.
- Throwing your last Remote Dynamite will lock you out of detonating it but you will still be able to select it and see the bundle in your hands despite not having any ammo left, I'll improvise something hopefully without spaghettifying the code.
### Credits
- Sprites mostly from Monolith.
