Like ZBlood but in ZScript so that it rhymes or whatever.
### What's this
This mod aims to recreate Blood's gameplay in GZDoom using the voodoo arts of ZScript. While it isn't a 1:1 recreation (duh), the goal is to make the gameplay feel as close to Blood as possible, while mantaining stuff fresh and nice, with unnecessarilly fancy particle effects that will chug on them slaughtermaps. Spill some!
